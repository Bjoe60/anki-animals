The thallus, or body of the lichen is spread out flat and can be either tightly to loosely attached to the growing surface. It is 0.15–0.30 mm thick, and can be smooth, or have low radiating ridges. The older, central region of the lichen surface has many reproductive structures called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isidia"" title=""Isidia"">isidia</a>; they resemble granules that are 0.1–0.4 by 0.1 mm. The species relies entirely on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetative_reproduction"" title=""Vegetative reproduction"">vegetative</a> means to reproduce, and is not known to have any sexual structures. From the center outwards, three color zones can be differentiated in mature specimens; the first grayish-green, the second white, and finally a bright red cottony rim. </p><p>The lichen has a distinct prothallus—fibers of whitish fungal <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypha"" title=""Hypha"">hyphae</a> at the edge that lack photobiont, and which project beyond the thallus onto the growing surface. The prothallus is red to whitish in the inner part, red the in outer part. The surface of the thallus does not have a well-defined cortex, an outer layer of well-packed hyphae. The medulla (a loosely arranged layer of hyphae below the cortex and photobiont zone) is whitish but the lower part is red.

While the International Botanical Congress recently emended the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Nomenclature_for_algae,_fungi,_and_plants"" title=""International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants"">International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants</a> to state that one fungal species should be called by one name, the sexual (teleomorphic) and asexual (anamorphic) stages of single fungal species have often been called by different names. <i>B. dothidea</i> was the name given to the teleomorphic form, and <i>Fusicoccum aesculi</i> has been identified the anamorph of <i>B. dothidea</i>, as currently defined. Phillips et al. (2013) chose to use the genus name <i>Botryosphaeria</i>, rather than <i>Fusicoccum</i>, since <i>Botryosphaeria</i> is commonly used and is the type genus of the family Botryosphaeriaceae. </p><p>Fries first published a description of <i>B. dothidea</i> as <i>Sphaeria dothidea</i> in <i>Systema Mycologicum</i> in 1823.

In the case of <i>B. dothidea</i>, these ascomata are pseudothecia. The asci in the pseudothecia produce ascospores that can then infect plants.

A narrow brown border surrounds the spot and, with age, the lesion may crack. When the disease first appears in the spring under moist conditions, the spots appear with or without a white speck surrounded by a much larger brown water-soaked border, giving the appearance of a different disease. The distinguishing sign on older spots is the presence of small, black, speck-like fruiting bodies called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pycnidium"" title=""Pycnidium"">pycnidia</a> embedded within the tissue.

It has been classified as a member of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphomycetes"" title=""Hyphomycetes"">Hyphomycetes</a>, in the Deuteromycota, as well as the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungi_Imperfecti"" title=""Fungi Imperfecti"">Fungi Imperfecti</a> because it is only known to reproduce asexually. Despite that it is not yeast-like, it has been included in the broad, unrelated category of fungi known as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_yeast"" title=""Black yeast"">black yeasts</a>. The fungus grows felty colonies in bright shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with brown or black throughout. Colonies grow quickly, reaching about 6 cm in diameter in 2 days at room temperature. Mycelia contain both chitin and cellulose. </p><p><i>Epicoccum nigrum</i> forms <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blastoconidium"" title=""Blastoconidium"">blastoconidia</a> that are darkly coloured, warted and spherical, reaching 15 to 25 μm in diameter.

Sporets have been found to contain up to 15 cells. The spores of <i>E. nigrum</i> are actively released depending on temperature, light, and relative humidity conditions. The mechanism of release involves the separation of the conidium from the sporodochium via a double septum. It capitalizes on the spherical shape of the conidia, allowing it to ""bounce"" off the sporodochium. Conidia then become airborne with movement or wind. Sporulation is induced under <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_light"" title=""Black light"">Wood's light</a>, or sometimes upon exposure to cold temperatures with a subsequent return to room temperature. Pigment production is also sensitive to light and temperature changes. Ideal growth temperatures range between 23–28 °C (73–82 °F), and ideal growth pH ranges from 5.0 to 6.0. Although <i>E. nigrum</i> will grow in a range of water activity (a<small>w</small> of 0.99 to 0.97), growth is optimized at water vapour saturation. </p><p>...

During the reproductive stages of its life cycle, <i>P. digitatum</i> reproduces asexually via the production of asexual spores or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conidium"" title=""Conidium"">conidia</a>. Conidia are borne on a stalk called a conidiophore that can emerge either from a piece of aerial hyphae or from a soil-embedded network of hyphae. The conidiophore is usually an asymmetrical, delicate structure with smooth, thin walls. Sizes can range from 70–150 μm in length. During development, the conidiophore can branch into three rami to produce a terverticillate structure although biverticillate and other irregular structures are often observed. At the end of each rami, another set of branches called metulae are found. The number of metulae varies with their sizes ranging from 15–30 × 4–6 μm. At the distal end of each metula, conidium-bearing structures called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phialide"" title=""Phialide"">phialides</a> form. Phialides can range in shape from flask-shaped to cylindrical and can be 10–20 μm long. The conidia produced, in turn, are smooth with a shape that can range from spherical to cylindrical although an oval shape is frequently seen. They are 6–15 μm long and are produced in chains, with the youngest at the base of each chain. Each conidium is haploid and bears only one nucleus. Sexual reproduction in <i>P. digitatum</i> has not been observed. </p><p><i>Penicillium digitatum</i> can also grow on a variety of laboratory media. On <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czapek_medium"" title=""Czapek medium"">Czapek Yeast Extract Agar medium</a> at 25 °C, white colonies grow in a plane, attaining a velvety to deeply floccose texture with colony sizes that are 33–35 mm in diameter.

At first, colonies are yellow-green but ultimately turn olive due to conidial production. Colony diameter can range in size from 35 mm to 70 mm. The reverse of the plate is similar to that observed for Czapek Yeast Extract Agar medium. On 25% Glycerol Nitrate Agar at 25 °C, colony growth is planar yet develops into a think gel with colony size diameter ranging from 6–12 mm. The back of the plate is described as pale or olive. At 5 °C, 25% Glycerol Nitrate Agar supports germination and a colonial growth of up to 3 mm in diameter. This species fails to grow at 37 °C. On Creatine Sucrose Agar at 25 °C, colony size diameter ranges from 4 to 10 mm. Growth is restricted and medium <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"" title=""PH"">pH</a> remains around 7.

A recent analysis has suggested that the prevalent North American genetic type and a less common type should be considered separate phylogenetic species, distinct from <i>H. capsulatum</i> isolates obtained in Central and South America and other parts of the world. These entities are temporarily designated NAm1 (the rare type, which includes a famous experimental isolate designated ""the Downs strain"") and NAm2 (the common type). As yet, no well-established clinical or geographic distinction is seen between these two genetic groups. </p><p>In its asexual form, the fungus grows as a colonial microfungus strongly similar in macromorphology to <i>B. dermatitidis</i>. A microscopic examination shows a marked distinction: <i>H. capsulatum</i> produces two types of conidia, globose macroconidia, 8–15 μm, with distinctive tuberculate or finger-like cell wall ornamentation, and ovoid microconidia, 2–4 μm, which appear smooth or finely roughened.

Apothecia are usually concave and often pruinose. <i>R. fraxinea</i> branches have a very distinctive shape, being widest toward the middle (as much as 4.5 cm in some specimens) and tapering at both the point of attachment and toward the tip (to about 1 cm). The thallus is green-grey in colour, pendent and may be as long as 10 cm. It has the overall appearance of being coarsely tufted, individual branches showing a channelled, wrinkled appearance. The branches may have a twist or turn to them. The apothecia are cup-like and convex and are found both along the edges of the branches and on the surface or lamina. </p><p>The Ramalinas are also known as 'bush', 'strap', or 'gristle' lichens.

The apothecia are accompanied by a conidial form, where non-sexual spores are generated. The conidial form consists of sporodochia, a cushion-like asexual fruiting body mass consisting of short conidiophores (specialized stalks that bear conidia). The sporodochia are similar in color and consistency to the apothecia but very variable in shape, typically club-, spoon-, or tongue-shaped, and bearing minute, cylindrical, straight or curved conidia. As the fungus matures and the apothecia enlarge and press against each other, the apothecia coalesce to form a gelatinous, irregular mass. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trama_(mycology)"" title=""Trama (mycology)"">flesh</a>, similar to the appearance of the fungus, is pinkish-purple and gelatinous.

Conidia are pinched out from the conidiophore one after another in alternating directions in order to form the characteristic zigzag patterned chain. Conidia of <i>T.roseum</i> (15-20 × 7.5-10 μm) are smooth and clavate. Each conidium is two celled with the apical cell being larger than the curved basal cell. Conidia are light pink and appear translucent under the microscope. They appear a more saturated pink colour when grown in masses in culture or on the host surface.

As an ascoymcete it has a sexual teleomorph form and an asexual anamorph form. <i>S. fimicola</i> typically follows the life cycle of an obligate dung fungus; sexual reproduction that is obligate to herbivore dung after passage through the herbivore's gastrointestinal tract. Following meiosis on dung, ascospores are discharged and stick onto plant surfaces where they are thought to remain epiphyllous. S. fimicola grows septate hyphae which at the macro level look like small dark brown fibers forming a fluffy sheet over the substrate. Small black spots will form when sexual reproduction occurs, as these spots are the location of the ascii. Additionally, there are tan and grey mutant strains of <i>S. fimicola</i>. <i>S. fimicola</i> grows best in carbon rich substrates, but it also needs access to nitrogen. Research has shown that <i>S. fimicola</i> grows best with a carbon:nitrogen ratio between 5:1 and 10:1, as <i>S. fimicola</i> grown under these conditions produces markedly more perithecium than in those with higher carbon ratios or higher nitrogen ratios. <i>S. fimicola</i> grows well in a laboratory setting and because of that it is often used in introductory biology laboratories and also as a model organism for research. <i>S. fimicola</i> is also a good tool for teaching meiosis as it quickly produces diploid perithecium which undergoes meiosis to produce ascii with ordered linear tetrads of haploid ascospores.

The spines, which are whitish, gray, or brown, can be easily rubbed off, and leave <a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/reticulate"" title=""wikt:reticulate"">reticulate</a> pock marks or scars after they are removed. The base of the puffball is thick. It is initially white, but turns yellow, olive, or brownish in age. The reticulate pattern resulting from the rubbed-off spines is less evident on the base. </p><p>In maturity, the exoperidium at the top of the puffball sloughs away, revealing a pre-formed hole (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostiole"" title=""Ostiole"">ostiole</a>) in the endoperidium, through which the spores can escape. In young puffballs, the internal contents, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleba"" title=""Gleba"">gleba</a>, is white and firm, but turns brown and powdery as the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spore"" title=""Spore"">spores</a> mature. The gleba contains minute chambers that are lined with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymenium"" title=""Hymenium"">hymenium</a> (the fertile, spore-bearing tissue); the chambers collapse when the spores mature. Mature puffballs release their powdery spores through the ostiole when they are compressed by touch or falling raindrops. A study of the spore release mechanism in <i>L. pyriforme</i> using high-speed <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlieren_photography"" title=""Schlieren photography"">schlieren photography</a> determined that raindrops of 1 mm diameter or greater, including rain drips from nearby trees, were sufficient to cause spore discharge. The puffed spores are ejected from the ostiole at a velocity of about 100 cm/second to form a centimeter-tall cloud one-hundredth of a second after impact. A single puff like this can release over a million spores. </p><p>... (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lycoperdon_perlatum"">Wikipedia</a>)</p>"

The fungus <i>Hypomyces tremellicola</i> is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasite"" title=""Parasite"">parasite</a> that deforms this species' cap. </p><p>The species is reportedly inedible, and too small to consider worthwhile.

The cap of <i>O. canarii</i> is also has a determining feature of intact and ruptured warts on the cap. </p><p>The life cycle of <i>O. canarii</i> is similar to that of most Agaricales in the way that the primary mycelium produced by the germination of basidiospore is of short duration. It is haploid with septate hyphae. The cells contain oil globules, vacuoles and are short and uninucleate. As a result of hyphal fusions, the primary mycelium becomes binucleate usually without clamp connections rarely with clamp connections. The mycelium with binucleate cells is called secondary or dikaryotie mycelium. It is long-lived and abundant. It produces mushrooms year after year. The hyphae are long and branched. Commonly the hyphae interlace and twist to form thick, white hyphal cords called the rhizomorphs which bear the fruiting bodies.

This fungus gives rise to very small fruit bodies (known as dwarf fruit-bodies), some of which are less than one-hundredth the size of the larger ones. In a series of experiments, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Henry_Reginald_Buller"" title=""Arthur Henry Reginald Buller"">Arthur Henry Reginald Buller</a> grew spores on horse dung and noted a large range of size variation: the smallest specimen having a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipe_(mycology)"" title=""Stipe (mycology)"">stem</a> length of 1 mm and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pileus_(mycology)"" title=""Pileus (mycology)"">cap</a> diameter of 0.75 mm, while the largest specimen had a stem length of 18.4 cm (<span>7<span>+</span><span>1</span>⁄<span>4</span></span> in) and cap diameter of 2 cm. Buller noted that the dwarf fruit-bodies are fully functional, producing and liberating spores in a manner identical with normal ones. The great variation in size has led some authors to erroneously name the dwarf fruit-bodies as new species. For example, George Edward Massee considered the dwarfs to be a new species, <i>Coprinus radiatus</i>. In general, dwarf fruit-bodies have stem lengths from 1–10 mm tall and cap of 0.75–3 mm in diameter, while large specimens have stems that are <link href=""mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1154941027"" rel=""mw-deduplicated-inline-style""/>5–18.5 cm (2–<span>7<span>+</span><span>1</span>⁄<span>4</span></span> in) tall and 2–5 mm wide, with cap diameters of <link href=""mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1154941027"" rel=""mw-deduplicated-inline-style""/>2–5 cm (<span><span>3</span>⁄<span>4</span></span>–2 in). The thickness of the stem in the larger specimens is typically 4–6 mm thick, up to 0.8 mm thick at the club-shaped or bulbous base. </p><p>The color of the cap surface is pale to very dark-brown at center beneath the whitish to silvery grey veil but becomes paler towards the margin. As the mushroom matures, the shape of the cap becomes more conical or convex, and finally flattens out, with edges curved upward.

However a 2012 paper by Vizzini et al. proposes updated definitions based on DNA analysis and suggests that some progress on these issues is being made. </p><p>It is a widely distributed species, known from Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, and Oceania. </p><p>Like all <i>Melanoleuca</i> it is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saprophytic"" title=""Saprophytic"">saprophytic</a>, feeding on organic litter and not being associated with particular types of tree. </p><p>A similar-looking species is <i>M. angelesiana</i>, but this does not have <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystidia"" title=""Cystidia"">cystidia</a> on its gills as does <i>M. melaleuca</i>.

Its convex cap measures 5–12 centimetres (2.0–4.7 in) across and broadens with age. The cap is dirty pinkish red when young, fading to a reddish cinnamon when old.

Some describe the smell of the mushroom as a ""curry-like"" odor, although descriptions of this smell vary.

He nevertheless suggests that there is correlation between the ""curry-like"" smell and the bluing reaction: ""But I can tell you that I have not found any of the variations in features to correlate with any of the others, with the possible exception of the curry odor and the more eagerly bruising collections, which often seem to go hand in hand (this may help explain the phenomenon of mislabeling anything that smells like curry as <i>Boletus sensibilis</i>).""

A smooth whitish mycelial layer covers the fruit body, and may be partially encrusted with debris. As the fruit body matures, the mycelial layer tears away, and the outer tissue layer, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peridium"" title=""Peridium"">exoperidium</a>, breaks open in a star-shaped (<a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/stellate"" title=""wikt:stellate"">stellate</a>) pattern to form 4–20 irregular ""rays"". This simultaneously pushes the fruit body above ground to reveal a round spore case enclosed in a thin papery endoperidium. The rays open and close in response to levels of moisture in the environment, opening up in high humidity, and closing when the air is dry. This is possible because the exoperidium is made of several different layers of tissue; the innermost, fibrous layer is hygroscopic, and curls or uncurls the entire ray as it loses or gains moisture from its surroundings. This adaptation enables the fruit body to disperse spores at times of optimum moisture, and reduce evaporation during dry periods. Further, dry fruit bodies with the rays curled up may be readily blown about by the wind, allowing them to scatter spores from the pore as they roll. </p><div> <blockquote> <p>""This veritable barometer is the most theatrical of all the earthstars.

The stipe is pure white, slightly convex underneath, from 6–12 cm (2.4–4.7 in) in height and 1.5–5 cm (0.6–2.0 in) in diameter. The spores are pure white.

The spores are hyaline and the dimensions are about 10-13 micrometers long and 3-4 micrometers wide. Some spores have a transverse medial septum separating two nuclei. Woronin first observed <i>Exobasidium</i>’s ability to produce asexual spores in 1867, and over a century later, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy has confirmed <i>E. vaccinii</i>’s ability to produce conidia from secondary spores. </p><p>There are no known reports of <i>E. vaccinii</i> forming <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appressorium"" title=""Appressorium"">appressoria</a>; however, there are numerous reports of appressoria forming in <i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exobasidium_vexans"" title=""Exobasidium vexans"">E. vexans</a></i>, which is pathogenic on tea, and among other members of the Ustilagomycetes. The intercellular hyphae are septate with short, lobed <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haustorium"" title=""Haustorium"">haustoria</a>. Hyphae and haustoria contacting host cells cause significant amounts of pressure and subsequent distortion in the surrounding tissues. Haustoria contain membranous inclusion bodies and are associated with electron-dense deposits, much like other plant pathogenic fungi.

Asparagoides</i>, and looking like warts. This is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermogonium"" title=""Spermogonium"">spermagonia</a> and pycnia stage of the disease cycle. Next, there are aecia, which take the form of cup-shapes and are also orange, but they are on the under side of the leaves. The aecia produce aeciospores, and lead to uredinia. Uredinia and telia are on the under side of the leaves, but also on stems. The uredeina are also orange and in the shape of pustules, while the telia are a brown-black color, but also in the shape of pustules. The uredinia produce urediniospores, which are dispersed by the wind. Telia occur several weeks later. Then the telia produce thick-walled resting spores called teliospores. </p><p><i>P. myrsiphylli</i> is likely macrocyclic because it includes all five spores stages. It is also likely autoecious because field reports show that pycnia, aecia, uredinia, and telia of <i>P. myrsiphylli</i> were found on <i>A. asparagoides</i>. No other host plants outside of <i>A. asparagoides</i> are required for <i>P. myrsiphylli</i> to complete its life cycle. The researchers in this study found dormant teliospores on extremely diseased cladodes and stems around spring/early summer time in the winter/rainfall region. This suggests that the fungus survives the dry summer months on debris, when above-ground biomass of host plants have stopped growing. It is the thick-walled teliospores that make sure the rust can survive when bridal creeper deteriorates during the summer. <i>P. myrsipjylli</i> recycles each 3–4 weeks during the summer. </p><p>...

If the medium the sporangia and spores land on is nutrient-dense, they will germinate and form one or more hyphal tubes, and the fungus will then continue its development and growth. <i>Conidiobolus</i> has three possible developmental pathways: (i) the fungus can remain in reproductive mode and form one or more secondary spores, (ii) the fungus may form a vegetative germ tube or (iii) it may not germinate at all.

The secondary spores may also go on to produce many smaller microspores. In young cultures, the <i>C. coronatus</i> spores have a smooth appearance; however, as they mature, the spores gradually become covered with short hair like projections called villi.
